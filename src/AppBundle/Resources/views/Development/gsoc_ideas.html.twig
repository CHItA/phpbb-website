				which might inspire your application. If you wish to submit a proposal based on these ideas, you may want to <a href="{{ GSOC }}#contact">contact</a> the available
				mentors for more detailed information.

				Feel free to discuss any project ideas you might have in addition to the ones listed here.

				Make sure to also read the <a href="{{ GSOC }}">GSoC Instructions</a>.

			<h3 class="gsoc-page"><a id="social-sharing" href="#social-sharing">Social Sharing</a></h3>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Summary</h4>
			<p>Create an extensible system supporting via an object oriented plugin system any number of 3rd party services to share content to. There may be different options, sharing a link to a topic or a particular post or maybe even a forum, or sharing complete posts or extracts of posts.</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<p>User interface changes for sharing buttons/dialogs/etc. as well as an administration control panel page with options on configuring the various services which might require API keys to work. A extensible interface that allows extensions to supply further sharing backends.</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Knowledge Prerequisites</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Object-oriented PHP</li>
				<li>Javascript required, jQuery or similar recommended</li>
				<li>Familiarity with social sharing APIs (Facebook/Twitter) useful but not mandatory</li>

			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a simple user interface for this functionality in the editor (e.g. dropdown menu with suggestions)</li>
				<li>Allow users to specify how they would like to be notified, when they are mentioned by someone else (email, notification etc)</li>
				<li>Allow the board administrator to enable/disable the feature, and also to allow them to restrict some of the user settings</li>

			<p>Implement a RESTful API that can be used to interact with phpBB from an outside source. Previous work on a RESTful authentication API can and should be used as a base for this (see the <a href="https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb/pull/3100">PR</a>).</p>
			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Update previously created code to be compatible with latest changes in phpBB</li>
				<li>Add more API functionality like adding or viewing posts / topics</li>
				<li>Allow the board administrator to enable/disable the API features</li>

			<h4 class="gsoc-page">Expected results</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Implementing the neccessary backend changes and adding events to the core</li>
				<li>
					Implementing the desktop notification extension with
					<ul>
						<li>Multi-browser support</li>

			<h2 class="gsoc-page"><a id="own-idea" href="#own-idea">Proposing your own idea</a></h2>
			<p>
				For non-website ideas, RFCs on <a href="{{ DEV_BOARD }}">Area51</a> are a good source of ideas as they represent what our users already told us they want. Most mentors are available in phpBB's IRC development channel <a href="{{ DEV_IRC_CHAT }}">#phpbb-dev</a> and on <a href="{{ DEV_BOARD }}">Area51</a>.
				For website ideas feel free to contact one of the website mentors (via IRC <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=phpbb-www">[#phpbb-www]</a> or email `website [at] phpbb [dot] com`).
			</p>
			<p>If you propose an original idea it will have a higher chance of being accepted if it satisfies the following two criteria:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Checkpointable</strong> -  it should be possible to break down your project into pieces that are by themselves meaningful. In practical terms, this means you should be sending a pull request every 1-2 weeks reflecting your work during that period, and the pull request should be individually mergeable. Avoid proposing a project that cannot be split into 1-2 week chunks.</li>
				<li><strong>Likely to be completed</strong> - this involves several factors, but at the end of the day the goal is for your work to be finished within the GSoC timeframe. You should start by detailing components of your project to sufficient extent that they can be estimated. Then, honestly estimate how long you think it will take you. Then double that estimate. If you exceed 3 months, your proposal is probably too ambitious and you should reduce its scope.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As always, if you are unsure about anything or have questions please don't hesitate to contact us. Also, please discuss your idea first before proposing it in your application.</p>
