	<p>
		<strong>Latest Branch of phpBB</strong>: 3.1.x (Ascraeus)<br />
		<strong>Branches in 'maintenance' stage</strong>: 3.0.x (Olympus), 3.1.x (Ascraeus)<br />
		<strong>Development Branch</strong>: 3.2.x (Rhea) <br />
	</p>

	<p>phpBB releases are time-based meaning we release a new minor (x.y) or major (x) release once every year around December. In between minor releases we release maintenance releases (x.y.z) which include bug and, when nessasary, security fixes. On occassion we also release patch level releases (x.y.z-PLn) which fix important issues introduced in a maintenance release.</p>

	<h2>End of Life / End of Maintenance</h2>
	<p>
		End of Maintenance (EOM) occurs to a branch 18 months after it's first stable release (3.x.0) release. When this occurs we:
		<ul>
			<li>Recommend you upgrade to the latest stable branch of phpBB</li>
			<li>Only patch security issues in new maintenance releases</li>
		</ul><p/>
	</p>
	<p>
		End of Life (EOL) occurs to a branch 24 months after it's 'gold' (3.x.0) release. When this occurs we:
		<ul>
			<li>Strongly recommend you upgrade your version of phpBB to the latest stable release</li>
			<li>No longer provide support for versions in a branch of phpBB except in upgrading from it to the latest branch of phpBB</li>
			<li>No longer patch security issues</li>
			<li>No longer make any releases of this branch</li>
			<li>No longer allow contributions for this branch to be submitted to our customisation database</li>
			<li>Begin actively purging documentation for this branch of phpBB</li>
		</ul><p/>
	</p>

	<h2>Contributing</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to contribute a bug fix and it affects all maintained branches it will go into the next maintenance release of the lowest supported branch. Therefore it will likely go into the next phpBB 3.0.x release (Github{#(TODO:Add a little icon here)#}: <a href="https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb/tree/develop-olympus">develop-olympus</a>) or for an 3.1.x only bug into the next phpBB 3.1.x release (Github{#(TODO:Add a little icon here)#}: <a href="https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb/tree/develop-ascraeus">develop-ascraeus</a>).<br /><br />
		If you want to contribute a new feature it will go into the development branch and go into phpBB 3.2.0 (Github{#(TODO:Add a little icon here)#}: <a href="https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb/tree/develop">develop</a>).
