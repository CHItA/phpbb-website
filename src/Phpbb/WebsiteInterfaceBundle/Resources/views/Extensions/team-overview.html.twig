            <p>The Extensions Team oversees all activities on phpBB.com with relation to extensions, including the validation of extensions submitted to the Customisation Database, maintaining useful extension related tools and scripts such as AutoMOD, UMIL and MODX and ensuring the smooth running of the extensions forums on phpBB.com.</p>

            <h3>Extensions Team</h3>

            <p>The Extensions Team is a great place to get involved with open source software and to help the phpBB project.</p>
            <p>After getting invited to join the Extensions Team, you will undergo training on how to moderate or how to validate extensions and use the validation tools.</p>
            <p>As with all phpBB Teams, all positions on the Extensions Team are unpaid volunteer positions.</p>

            <h3>Junior Validators</h3>

            <p>The Extensions Team is always on the look-out for new Junior Validators. Junior Validators are extension authors that assist the Extensions Team with the validation of extensions submitted to the Customisation Database. The task of a Junior Validator is to test extensions in the Extensions Queue (in the Customisation Database), and to offer feedback about the extension.</p>
            <p>The Extensions Team primarily selects new Extension Team Validators from the Junior Validators. </p>
