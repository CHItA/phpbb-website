# Contributing

Contributions by any and all are welcomed and appreciated. However we just have a few notes and
handy hints for you.

If possible please ensure that you have full code coverage & passing tests for any contributed
code however if you're not sure about how tests work then let us know and we'll add/fix them.

If you want any help with anything, you're welcome to email website [at] phpbb [dot] com or
as on IRC in `#phpbb-dev` on `irc.freenode.net` (If you mention it's about the website someone
will refer you to the right people).

We primarily follow PSR coding guidelines however we have some extra requirements
(and changes such as tabs for indentation) but we'll help you with these in Pull Requests.

Please try and use topic branches or keep everything in one pull request related to one thing.

Please keep the first line of commit messages as a short description, followed by a blank line.
Any further description can precede this. If it refers to a ticket please mention this on
the latter lines (i.e. `Fixes #11` for github issues or `Fixes Ticket WEB-49857`
for JIRA issues).

PHP 5.3.3 can be taken as a minimum requirement for all contributed code to work with and work on all
php branches up to and including the latest formal release.

Finally the boring legal bit:
You agree to relinquish any rights to the code you have contributed/are contributing and
relicense it to phpBB Limited. At this time we release the code under the GPLv3 but we reserve
the right to change the license in the future if we wish.

Thanks for contributing!
